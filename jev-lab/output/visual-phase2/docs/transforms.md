# Groups, transforms and draw order



Everything visible in an artboard sits in a tree, and its position on screen is

the product of its own transform and every transform above it. This is the part

of the format you use in every file without thinking about it — until something

lands in the wrong place.



## Node is the group



A `Node` draws nothing. It exists to hold a transform that its children inherit:



```xml

<Node x="150" y="100" rotation="0.5235988" name="Dial" id="0:20">

    <Shape name="Hand" id="0:21">

        <Rectangle width="4" height="60" name="Path"/>

        <Fill name="Fill"><SolidColor colorValue="FFE0573C" name="C"/></Fill>

    </Shape>

    <Shape x="0" y="-60" name="Tip" id="0:22">

        <Ellipse width="10" height="10" name="Path"/>

        <Fill name="Fill"><SolidColor colorValue="FFFFFFFF" name="C"/></Fill>

    </Shape>

</Node>

```



Rotating the `Node` swings both children around the node's origin. This is what

the editor calls a **group**, and it is the standard way to build anything that

pivots: put the children in a group positioned at the pivot point, then animate

the group rather than the parts.



It is also the cheapest fix for an object that rotates about the wrong point.

Rather than offsetting the shape, wrap it in a `Node` placed where the pivot

belongs and key that.



## The shared transform properties



Every positioned object — `Node`, `Shape`, `Text`, `Bone`, `Solo`,

`LayoutComponent` — carries the same set, inherited from `TransformComponent`:



| Property | Default | Note |

|---|---|---|

| `x`, `y` | `0` | position in the parent's space |

| `rotation` | `0` | **radians**; a full turn is `6.2831855` |

| `scaleX`, `scaleY` | `1` | negative values mirror |

| `opacity` | `1` | `0`–`1` |



All six are animatable *and* bindable, which is most of what a Rive file

animates. `x` is propertyKey 13, `y` 14, `rotation` 15, `scaleX` 16, `scaleY`

17, `opacity` 18 — the keys you will key and bind most often.



Children are positioned in their parent's space, so a child at `x="0"` sits at

the parent's origin, not the artboard's.



## Opacity multiplies



A group's opacity is not just its own — it is multiplied into every descendant.

A `Node` at `opacity="0.5"` containing a shape at `opacity="0.5"` renders that

shape at `0.25`.



That makes a wrapping `Node` the way to fade a whole assembly with one keyed

property, instead of keying opacity on each part. It also means an assembly that

will not become fully visible usually has a partly-transparent ancestor.



## Hiding without deleting



`Component.flags` carries bits written as individual attributes:



```xml

<Shape hidden="true" name="Debug Overlay" id="0:30"/>

```



`hidden` removes it from rendering, `locked` and `guide` are editor affordances,

and `guide` marks it as a non-exporting reference object.



For switching between variants at runtime, use a `Solo` rather than keying

`hidden` — see [rigging.md](rigging.md#solo).



## Origin



`originX` and `originY` on the artboard are **normalized**, not pixels: `0` is

the left/top edge, `0.5` the centre, `1` the right/bottom.



```xml

<Artboard originX="0.5" originY="0.5" width="500" height="500" name="A" id="0:2"/>

```



The origin is where the artboard is anchored when a runtime positions it, so a

centred origin is what you want for anything that scales or rotates as a whole.



**It also shifts the artboard's own coordinate space, so it is not free.** With

`originX="0.5" originY="0.5"` on a 500×500 artboard, content authored at

`(250,250)` no longer sits in the middle — every child moves by half the

artboard and most of the scene leaves the frame. The build stays clean and

`problems` stays empty, so it reads as a layout bug. Leave the origin at `0`

unless a host is positioning the artboard and you know it wants a centred

anchor, and re-place content when you change it.



Procedural shapes have their own `originX`/`originY` with the same normalized

meaning — that is how a `Rectangle` grows from its centre rather than its

corner, covered in [drawing.md](drawing.md).



## Draw order



**The first sibling draws on top.** Declaration order is front-to-back, the way

a layers panel in a design tool reads — the thing you write first is the thing

in front.



This catches people out, because it is the opposite of HTML and SVG. If a shape

you added is invisible, this is the first thing to suspect: it is almost

certainly behind a sibling you declared earlier, and nothing in `--verify` or

`inspect` will say so.



```xml

<Node name="Badge">

    <Shape name="Dot"><Ellipse width="12" height="12" name="P"/>

        <Fill name="F"><SolidColor colorValue="FFFFFFFF" name="C"/></Fill></Shape>

    <Shape name="Plate"><Ellipse width="64" height="64" name="P"/>

        <Fill name="F"><SolidColor colorValue="FF6C5CE7" name="C"/></Fill></Shape>

</Node>

```



The dot is on top of the plate. Swap them and the dot disappears behind it.



So to put something in front, move it **earlier** in its parent's children.

Nesting does not change the rule, and it is the same whether the parent is a

`Node`, a `LayoutComponent` or the artboard itself.



### Overriding it



`DrawRules` and `DrawTarget` override hierarchy order, which is how you animate

one part moving in front of another without restructuring the tree:



```xml

<Shape name="Card" id="0:20">

    <Rectangle width="80" height="120" name="Path"/>

    <Fill name="Fill"><SolidColor colorValue="FF2A2F3A" name="C"/></Fill>

</Shape>



<Shape name="Chip" id="0:21">

    <Rectangle width="40" height="40" name="Path"/>

    <Fill name="Fill"><SolidColor colorValue="FFE0B057" name="C"/></Fill>



    <DrawRules drawTargetId="0:31" name="Rules" id="0:30">

        <DrawTarget drawableId="0:20" placementValue="before" name="Above card" id="0:31"/>

    </DrawRules>

</Shape>

```



`DrawRules` attaches to the object being reordered and names the active

`DrawTarget`, which must be nested inside it. The runtime collects targets

from each rule's children, so a target declared anywhere else is never

registered and the rule silently does nothing. `inspect` reports that as

`draw-target-not-child-of-rules`. The target names some other drawable and

whether to sit `before` or `after` it in the painted order. `before` draws

the ruled object on top of the target and `after` draws it behind. The chip

above is declared later than the card, so tree order would put it behind,

and the rule brings it to the front.



`drawTargetId` is animatable, so keying it between targets is how a card is

dealt to the top of a stack.



Reordering the tree is almost always simpler. Reach for it only when the order has to change

over time.



## Blend modes



Every drawable has `blendModeValue`, controlling how it composites with what is

beneath:



```xml

<Shape blendModeValue="screen" name="Glow" id="0:20">

    <Ellipse width="120" height="120" name="Path"/>

    <Fill name="Fill"><SolidColor colorValue="FF57A5E0" name="C"/></Fill>

</Shape>

```



Accepted names: `srcOver` (the default, ordinary alpha compositing), `screen`,

`overlay`, `darken`, `lighten`, `colorDodge`, `colorBurn`, `hardLight`,

`softLight`, `difference`, `exclusion`, `multiply`, `hue`, `saturation`,

`color`, `luminosity`.



The underlying integers are not contiguous — `srcOver` is `3` and the rest run

from `14` — so use the names. Files exported from the editor contain the raw

numbers, which is why a decompiled `.rev` shows `blendModeValue="15"` where you

would write `overlay`.



Blend mode is neither animatable nor bindable. To change compositing over time,

key opacity, or swap between two shapes with a `Solo`.



### Fills and strokes have a separate one



Confusingly, `Fill` and `Stroke` carry their **own** `blendModeValue` — a

different property from the drawable's, letting one paint composite differently

from the shape as a whole.



It does **not** accept the names. It is numeric only, and its default is `127`,

meaning *inherit from the shape*:



```xml

<Shape blendModeValue="screen" name="Glow" id="0:20">   <!-- names work here -->

    <Fill blendModeValue="14" name="Fill">              <!-- numbers only here -->

        <SolidColor colorValue="FF57A5E0" name="C"/>

    </Fill>

</Shape>

```



Writing `blendModeValue="screen"` on a `Fill` is a build error, not a silent

one, so you will find out immediately. Set the mode on the shape unless you

specifically need the paint to differ, and expect to see `127` on every `Fill`

in `rive inspect` output — that is the inherit sentinel, not a real mode.



## Clipping



Clipping is a `ClippingShape` child naming the shape to clip against — see

[drawing.md](drawing.md#effects-and-clipping).



## Checking your work



Transform bugs are position bugs, and `inspect` resolves the tree so you can see

where something actually ended up:



```bash

rive inspect . --json | jq '[..|objects|select((.type//"")=="Node")|{name,x,y,rotation}]'

```



If a group's `rotation` reads `0` when you keyed it, the keys went onto the

shape rather than the group — a common outcome when the `KeyedObject.objectId`

names the wrong id.
